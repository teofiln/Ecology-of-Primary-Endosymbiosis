Data and code to reconstruct ancestral states for salinity for the most recent common ancestor of archaeplastids

The folder Sanchez-Baracaldo_etal_2017_Data contains the original data posted on DataDryad (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.421p2). Within that folder, the directory `hab` has the habitat data parsed from the `XML` and `Nexus` files, called `nexml-data` and `nexus-data`, respectively. See the `Salinity-and-Endosymbiosis.Rmd` file for the code we used to parse the data from each file. All `R` code to produce the tables and figures is in `Salinity-and-Endosymbiosis.Rmd`.
